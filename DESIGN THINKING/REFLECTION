DESIGN THINKING
Reflection from Alisya, by doing this App about how to find a job for disable people 
make my eyes open to new things that I need to discovered. It makes me want to help more 
disable people in this world. Other than that, I also learn about how to solve the problem and 
think a solution to solved it. I also learn a new thing about getting opinion from other people 
and make their problem into something that we need to solve that the thing becoming a most 
efficient way. After that, we can think out of the box of how we need to solve this problem until 
we have a great solution. Lastly, by doing this project I have built a good connection with my 
team members.
