INDUSTRY TALK
According to Alisya's reflection, this industrial discussion taught me a lot about the 
abilities I need to develop if I want to stay in the computer science profession. I have a lot to 
study during this degree program in order to become a better programmer in the future. I have 
to learn something new and leave my comfort zone in order to gain fresh knowledge. In 
addition, I must possess soft abilities in communication and situational and interpersonal 
management.
